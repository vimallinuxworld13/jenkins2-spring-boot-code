= Spring Boot Neo4j Sample

This sample demonstrates the integration of Neo4j with a simple entity. It
expects a Neo4j instance running on `localhost`. If your neo4j instance
requires authentication, update `application.properties` with your credentials:

```
spring.data.neo4j.username=neo4j
spring.data.neo4j.password=secret
```

You can also locally add the embedded driver to embed Neo4j instead. Note
that Spring Boot does not provide dependency management for that GPL-licensed
library:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver</artifactId>
    <version>${neo4j-ogm.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
